# Miner Switcher

A simple auto switcher script that I made to mine the most profitable coin.

## Installation

Compile and run program by typing "python3 miner-switcher.py"

## Usage

There are 2 things you must change in the code for this to work for you:

1) Your hashrate values for ethereum and xmr mining. These are global variables in the program.

2) The locations of your ethereum and xmr miner start batch scripts.
